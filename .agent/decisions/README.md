# Antigravity Decisions (The Cortex) 🧠

## Purpose

This folder contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**.
While `memory/` stores facts, and `PLAN.md` stores tasks, `decisions/` stores the **reasoning** behind major choices.

## Why use this?

In 6 months, you will wonder: *"Why did we split `users` and `modules`?"* or *"Why did we choose `sops-nix` over `agenix`?"*
The Cortex holds the answer.

## Format

Files are numbered sequentially: `001-title-of-decision.md`
