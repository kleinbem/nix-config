# Home Manager Coverage & Gap Analysis

Before migrating to `systemd-homed` (wiping `/home`), you must address these "Imperative" (Unmanaged) items. If you wipe the disk, these **WILL BE LOST** unless you back them up manually.

## 🚨 Critical (Must Backup)

These files contain secrets or unique config not in your git repo.

| Path | Description | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `~/.ssh/` | SSH Keys (GitHub, Servers) | **Backup to USB** (Public keys are safe in repo, Private keys are hardware/imperative). |
| `~/.config/sops/` | SOPS Age Keys | **Backup to USB** (Critical for decrypting secrets). |
| `~/.config/rclone/` | Google Drive Config | **Backup `rclone.conf`** or re-authenticate later. |
| `~/.config/Yubico/` | `u2f_keys` (Sudo) | **Backup to Bitwarden** (as per walkthrough). |

## ⚠️ Important State (Will Reset)

These apps store their config "statefully" on disk. You will start fresh unless backed up.

| App | Path | Setup Type | Consequence of Wipe |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neovim** | `~/.config/nvim` | Git Clone (Imperative) | You must re-run `git clone` after migration. |
| **VS Code** | `~/.config/Code` | Imperative | You lose extensions/settings. Turn on "Settings Sync" (GitHub) to save them. |
| **Google Chrome** | `~/.config/google-chrome` | Imperative | You lose cookies/history. Ensure "Google Sync" is ON. |
| **Bitwarden** | `~/.config/Bitwarden` | App State | You just need to log in again. |
| **Zellij** | `~/.config/zellij` | Default | Safe (if using defaults). |

## ✅ Fully Managed (Safe)

These are generated by Nix and will reappear automatically.

* `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`
* `~/.gitconfig`
* `~/.config/starship.toml`
* `~/.config/dconf` (GTK Settings)
* `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`

## Recommendation

1. **Backup the "Critical" list** physically (USB).
2. **Sync the "Important" list** to cloud (GitHub Sync, Chrome Sync).
3. **Accept** that some local state (opened tabs, command history) limits will be reset.
